# PackMe - Custom File Archiver

PackMe is a custom file archiver developed in Go using the Wails framework, designed to compress files into a proprietary `.PackMe` format.

## ðŸ”§ Key Features

- **Custom .PackMe Format**: Proprietary compression format with advanced algorithms
- **Huffman Coding**: Implements entropy-based compression for optimal file size reduction
- **Z-function Algorithm**: Uses pattern detection for compression optimization
- **Cross-platform**: Built with Wails framework for desktop applications
- **Full Cycle Support**: Both compression and decompression capabilities

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Implementation

The project demonstrates several advanced computer science concepts:

- **Binary Trees**: Huffman tree construction for optimal encoding
- **Data Structures**: Efficient handling of file data and compression metadata
- **Pattern Recognition**: Z-function implementation for redundancy detection
- **File I/O**: Custom binary format handling and file system operations

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **Framework**: Wails (for desktop GUI)
- **Algorithms**: Huffman coding, Z-function
- **Architecture**: Event-driven with clean separation of concerns

## ðŸ“š Educational Value

This project serves as an excellent learning resource for:
- Understanding compression algorithms
- Exploring data structures like binary trees
- Learning about file format design
- Practicing Go programming with GUI frameworks
